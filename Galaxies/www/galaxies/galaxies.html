    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <li>Please don't try to visit other stars while you are looking at a solar system!  When you are
      at this scale the stars are very far away.  If you switch into "stars" mode,
      by clicking the button in the top right that reads "planets &gt;&gt; stars", the distances are
      much more manageable.</li>
    <li>The arrow keys, the space bar and the delete button will move you around in space.  The longer
      you hold down a button the farther you will go.  If you become impatient with how long it takes
      to reach other stars, hold down the "alt" key at the same time as the other keys.  You can also
      move forward and right at the same time, for instance, by holding down both keys at once.</li>
    <li>Please notice that the buttons in the top right sometimes have two different sides you can
      click on.  For instance, clicking on the left side of the time scale button slows time down and
      clicking on the right side speeds it up.</li>
    <li>One of the more intriguing features is the ability to see solar systems other than our own.
      To visit other stars, please first leave "planets" mode by clicking the 'scale' button that
      shows "planets >> stars".  Now, click on the 'exoplanets' button to highlight stars with known
      planets.  Now you can speed off toward one of them, using the arrow keys and the space bar.
      To move substantially faster, hold down the "alt" key while you are pressing the other keys.
      Once you get close enough you can double click on the star and it will 'zoom in' to show you
      the planets.</li>

    <p/>
    <h2>Errata</h2>
    <li>Displayed radii, even in 'small' mode are much larger than they would be
      if you were to look up at the sky.  In most cases, every object would occupy a single pixel if
      drawn accurately, and that wouldn't be very exciting.  In some solar systems, the magnification is
      a bit too much.</li>
    <li>Alpha Centauri can be found by searching for "alpha cen".  To find Gliese 581, search for "GJ 581".
      Star names have been taken literally from their various sources, and have not yet been 'enhanced' for
      easier searching.</li>
